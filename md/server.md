## [Server setup](../readme.md)
```
All the examples given point to the Development Ternoa's Market Place environment using the base URL: 
https://sdkdev.ternoa.dev.
```
In case you'd like to launch your own local SDK, simply run the following step:
### Start the server locally
```
npm install
node server.js
```
> ⚠️ Nodemon is not compatible
```
Once your local SDK is up, follow all the examples below replacing the base URL with your local one. 
By default, it will be up on http://localhost:3000.
```
